Gopher exercises was a bit more advanced than where I wanted to start. The Free code Camp Go tutorial seems a better place.

I finished Tech with Nana's few hour long go introduction. Alot of good basics in there. Also working on some of the othe intro videos that were not code centric and added a good bit of notes to obsian for future reference
